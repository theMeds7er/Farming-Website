                    <p>In partnership with TSTF, we will explore how an urban food system coalition consisting of Black and
                        Brown
                        community organizations perceives the role of (smart) technologies in fostering food sovereignty in
                        low-income and historically marginalized and/or racialized settings.
                        We are simultaneously co-designing urban gardens toward supporting the goals of food sovereignty and
                        justice
                        identified by TSTF.

                    <p>In an interview study with hydroponic farmers located in Seattle and PNW more broadly, 
                        we aim to understand the motivations and current practices of hydroponic farming in an urban landscape. 
                        We also aim to identify needs and priorities associated with smart technologies as experienced by 
                        community organizations currently pursuing this farming method.
